# consul

ZooKeeper, doozerd, and etcd are all similar in their architecture. All three have server nodes that require a quorum of nodes to operate (usually a simple majority). They are strongly-consistent and expose various primitives that can be used through client libraries within applications to build complex distributed systems.

Consul also uses server nodes within a single datacenter. In each datacenter, Consul servers require a quorum to operate and provide **strong consistency**. However, Consul has native support for multiple datacenters as well as a more feature-rich gossip system that links server nodes and clients.

# zookeeper

ZooKeeper was designed to store coordination data: status information, configuration, location information, etc., so the data stored at each       node is usually small, in the byte to kilobyte range.

The data stored at each znode in a namespace is read and written atomically. Reads get all the data bytes associated with a znode and a       write replaces all the data.



As part of the agreement protocol all write requests from clients are forwarded to a single server, called the *leader*. The rest of the ZooKeeper servers, called *followers*, receive message proposals from the leader and agree upon message delivery. The messaging layer takes care of replacing leaders on failures and syncing followers with leaders.

## Getting Started

###  /conf/zoo.cfg

```
tickTime=2000
dataDir=D:\zoodata
clientPort=2181
```

> note: path can't have space code e.g. `D:\Program Files\zookeeper-3.4.10\user-define-data`

### start cmd

```
zkServer.cmd
```



### Multiple servers on a single machine

> D:\Program Files\zookeeper-cluster\zk-server-1\conf\zoo.cfg

```
# The number of milliseconds of each tick
tickTime=2000

# The number of ticks that the initial synchronization phase can take
initLimit=10

# The number of ticks that can pass between 
# sending a request and getting an acknowledgement
syncLimit=5

# the directory where the snapshot is stored.
# Choose appropriately for your environment
dataDir=D:\\zkdata\\cluster\\zk1

# the port at which the clients will connect
clientPort=2181


# ZooKeeper server and its port no.
# ZooKeeper ensemble should know about every other machine in the ensemble
# specify server id by creating 'myid' file in the dataDir
# use hostname instead of IP address for convenient maintenance
server.1=localhost:2888:3888
server.2=localhost:2889:3889
server.3=localhost:2890:3890
```

> D:\zkdata\cluster\zk1\myid

```
1
```
